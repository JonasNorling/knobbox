This is a piece of code that implements a MIDI controller and step
sequencer in a STM32 (ARMv7-M) MCU.

\section buidling Building

You need an ARM toolchain and libopencm3 to build the project. The
toolchain from summon-arm-toolchain is the recommended one [1].

Modify the Makefile to point to your toolchain install directory and
type "make all" to build the project. I typically use gdb (from s-a-t)
and stlink[2] to flash the microcontroller, using an ST Discovery
board.

A trivial host version will also be built. This version runs much of
the same code as the stm32 version, but makes only a few passes
through the main loop to generate a display screenshot.


\section hardware Hardware

See comments in main.cpp.

\section guide Code guide

A number of key classes are instantiated as global variables in
main.cpp. The code makes liberal use of those.

Most device-specific setup, such as clocks, GPIO pins, subsystem
settings and interrupts, is done in stm32.cpp. Some emulation and
stubs for host builds are implemented in host.h and host.cpp.
