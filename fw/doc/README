This is a piece of code that implements a MIDI controller and step
sequencer in a STM32 (ARMv7-M) MCU.

BUILDING
---------------------------------------------------------

You need an ARM toolchain and libopencm3 to build the project. The
toolchain from summon-arm-toolchain is the recommended one [1].

Modify the Makefile to point to your toolchain install directory and
type "make all" to build the project. I typically use gdb (from s-a-t)
and stlink[2] to flash the microcontroller, using an ST Discovery
board.


DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------------

Type "make doc" in the source tree, and Doxygen documentation will pop
up in doc/html/.
